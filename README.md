It's a Good Day
===============

it’s a good day  
it’s a national day of civic hacking  
‘cause there’s too much good code that’s been lacking  
so let’s get cracking  
let’s have a good day

when it comes to hacking  
it’s important to know that we’re not pirates  
and we’re not going to bring our best virus  
so you can hire us  
to solve the problems that need solving in the world

---

there’s so much to do  
maybe we could detect some asteroids and keep the world from blowing up  
ooh, i don’t want to blow up, thank you NASA

Small business owners want to serve the local people  
They need to know just who they are, and where they live  
And that’s where the census comes in  
These are just two of the many projects you can work on, on National Day  

---

it’s two days  
two national days might be exhausting  
and the problems we face are pretty daunting  
so be strong, Boston  
let’s have a good day

---

there’s a lot to do  
if you want to solve some local problems, like gentrification or poverty  
we’ve got a lot of green spaces, but life would be better if I could find them  
We’ve got a lot of education data, but how do we use it to make our kids smarter? and how will we know if they're smart  
Have you ever waited for the green line? Well MBTA Alerts is here to help
